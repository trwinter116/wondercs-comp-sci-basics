# Wonder Generations Computer Science Basics Course Curriculum

This repository contains lesson plans for the Wonder Generations Comp Sci Basics course.
It was based off of [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com/), and largely lines up with their chapter outlines.

Each folder contains a set of examples to go through with the students and then a series of exercises for the students to complete. Potential solution for the exercises are included, but they are just recommendations,
as we know there are many qays to achieve the same results in programming.

All dependencies for this repo are managed using the tool Poetry. Documentation for the tool can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

For any questions related to the curriculum please reach out to @trwinter116.
