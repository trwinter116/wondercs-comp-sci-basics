# Exercise 1
# Write a function named readposint that uses the input dialog to prompt the user for a
# positive integer and then checks the input to confirm that it meets the requirements.
# It should be able to handle inputs that cannot be converted to int, as well as negative
# ints, and edge cases (e.g. when the user closes the dialog, or does not enter anything
# at all.)
