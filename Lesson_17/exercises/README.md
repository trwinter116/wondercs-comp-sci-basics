# Lesson 17 Exercises

The exercises for this lesson revolve around a pre-built game in PyGame's examples. It's
all about having fun! As you explore the game code there is one bug that you need to fix,
and several constants that you can update to change the way the game is played.

The bug is found in how the aliens interact with each other. Currently, when they overlap/collide
there are no consequences! I think that this should cause them to explode and remove them
from the game. A place to write code to accomplish can be found on line 365 of aliens.py.
The other collision logic is around this for you to reference as you work on the problem.

There are several constants you can modify to change how the game behaves, see what you can
do to increase your fire rate, number of shots you can fire, how fast or slow aliens spawn and
how fast or slow they decide to drop bombs to attack you!

Lastly, the frame rate is intentionally limited in the bottom of the loop, what happens
when you change it?
