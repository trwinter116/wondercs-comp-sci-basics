# Final Project Exercise

For your final project, you'll be taking everything that you've learned this year to make
your own card game! Everything we went through last week for the OldMaidGame is available
for you to reference, and if you need any assistance just ask. Have fun with this and be
creative!

I recommend making a new file for your card game and importing all of the base classes into
it for your use.
