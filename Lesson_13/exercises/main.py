# 'snake'.

# Write a function that reads a text file and produces an output file which is a copy of
# the file, except the first five columns of each line contain a four digit line number,
# followed by a space. Start numbering the first line in the output file at 1. Ensure that
# every line number is formatted to the same width in the output file.
